# GMU 44 Elk Scouting Tool — Project Handoff

Paste this at the start of a new conversation. It is written to be read cold.

---

## 1. What this is

A backcountry elk hunting map for Colorado GMU 44 (White River National Forest,
Frying Pan drainage — Meredith, Thomasville, Mount Thomas, Crowley Point). Built
by one person for his own archery hunt, now being taken toward something
sellable. Two things make it unusual and neither is available in any commercial
app:

1. **Off-trail routing on a terrain cost surface.** A 9-factor model scores every
   17 m cell for how hard it is to walk, and A* finds the cheapest line between
   two points. Not snapped to trails.
2. **Scent-aware routing.** Under draining thermals, cold air follows the same
   paths water does. The router avoids ground whose drainage reaches the animal.

Everything else — waypoints, layers, navigation — is table stakes and should be
built plainly, copying established conventions.

## 2. Current state

### Two apps, both live

| File | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `index.html` | Original OpenSeadragon build, 7 MB, build B25 | Frozen. Reference only. Do not add features. |
| `app.html` | MapLibre GL JS rebuild, 117 KB, **build C12** | Active development. |
| `sw.js` | Service worker for offline | Active. `CACHE_VERSION = 'gmu44-v2'` |

`app.html` is the one being worked on. `index.html` stays live because it is the
known-good reference — several bugs were caught by comparing the two.

### Repo layout

```
/app.html            MapLibre build
/index.html          old OpenSeadragon build (frozen)
/sw.js               service worker
/tiles/              PMTiles archives (see below)
/grids/              routing grids as PNG (see below)
/data/               access points + trail topology as JSON
/GeoPDFs/            4 USGS quads, 208 MB (source material)
/base_topo_files/    old DZI pyramid (source for the topo tiles)
/*_files/            ~30 other DZI pyramids from the old build
```

### Tiles — pushed and live in `/tiles/`

| File | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `gmu44_topo.pmtiles` | 52.7 MB | USGS quads, JPEG, z8–15 |
| `gmu44_terrain.pmtiles` | 85.5 MB | Terrain-RGB, PNG, z8–14 |
| `gmu44_elk_probability.pmtiles` | 4.5 MB | hotspots |
| `gmu44_canopy_band1–4.pmtiles` | 0.7–3.7 MB | 4 of 6 bands |

Built but **not pushed**: `gmu44_terrain_z11/z12/z13` (smaller variants, only made
because pushing 85 MB was failing). Not needed.

**Not built:** canopy bands 5–6, all forage bands, roaddist bands. Deliberate —
LANDFIRE GeoTIFFs will replace them with real per-cell values.

**Deliberately skipped forever:** `elev_above_*`, `elev_below_*` (12 layers) and
`aspect_*` (4 layers). These are pre-rendered pictures of values MapLibre now
derives live from the DEM.

### Grids — in `/grids/`, loaded into memory at startup

| File | Decode | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `cost_grid.png` | **R channel byte only**, 0–255 | terrain cost |
| `elev_grid.png` | `(R*256+G) * 0.25` = feet | elevation |
| `stealth_risk_grid.png` | R channel byte, tier 0–3 | elk-probability risk |

These decodes are **exact and were each got wrong once**. Do not guess them.

### Data — in `/data/`

- `access_points.json` — 3,773 points, `[lat, lon, type]`, type 0 = road (2,768)
- `trails_topology.json` — 139 trails with `pts`, `trailheadStart`, `trailheadEnd`

## 3. Critical constants — never re-derive these

```js
var W = 14989, H = 10004;                    // source mosaic size in px
var COST_GRID_W = 1873, COST_GRID_H = 1250;  // same for ELEV_GRID
var GEO_LON0 = -106.8750600, GEO_LAT0 = 39.5000693;   // upper-left
var GEO_LON1 = -106.5003350, GEO_LAT1 = 39.2499693;   // lower-right
var IMPASSABLE = 100000;
var COST_LOG_MIN = Math.log(0.02), COST_LOG_MAX = Math.log(28.35);
var HEURISTIC_PER_CELL = 0.30;
```

Georeferencing validated against Mount Massive (14,411 vs 14,421 published) and
Mount of the Holy Cross (14,004 vs 14,011). Within 10 ft.

`costAt` returns `exp(COST_LOG_MIN + (byte/255) * (COST_LOG_MAX - COST_LOG_MIN))`
→ range 0.020 to 28.35, median 1.275.

## 4. Features currently working in `app.html`

**Layout.** Full-screen map, five bottom tabs (Map, Route, Waypoints, Guide,
Tools), each opening a sheet. Swipe down to dismiss. Three round buttons right
edge: 2D/3D, locate, compass rose. Scale bar + live elevation + build tag top-left.

**Tap the map** → point card with coordinates, Copy button, elevation, then
actions: route destination, route start, my position, and save as one of 8
waypoint types (Location, Parking, Glassing, Water, Deadfall, Camp, Sign, Kill
site). Waypoints persist in localStorage.

**Routing.** A* on the cost grid, ~0.4 s typical. Start modes: nearest road
(auto), pick on map, my position. Auto-start uses multi-source Dijkstra outward
from the destination and **stops at the first candidate reached** — provably the
cheapest, and 107× less work than waiting for all of them.

**Guide.** Weapon / season stage / pressure / time of day → picks a posture from
`GUIDE_KB` (locate, full_vocal, cow_calf, silent), builds the scent mask, routes
with the drainage constraint, drops numbered stops, lists plan steps and triggers
with sources.

**Scent model.** `SCENT_HARD_M = 400` (hard block), `SCENT_ADVISORY_M = 800`
(4× cost penalty), `SCENT_CAPTURE_M = 75` lateral, plus a dispersion constant so a
plume spreads like cold air rather than threading one cell like water. Reverse
BFS from a seed ring around the pin; sign flips for midday (rising) vs
morning/evening (draining). Only active when a time of day is set.

**Ask the Guide.** 23 scenarios, 7 categories, filtered by weapon. House position
is **restraint** — cow/calf over bugling, back out over pushing, because Colorado
OTC ground is pressured. Aggressive school (Jacobsen, Warren) preserved under
"Other views" rather than blended away. Position-aware scenarios check whether
you are in the scent block or on the wrong side of the thermal and lead with that.

**Navigation.** Begin route → heading-up oblique camera (pitch 60, zoom 15.4),
distance to go, climb left, next stop with bearing, graded off-route, free look
with Recentre, Ask the guide inline, simulator that walks the route at 12 m/s.
Tab bar stays available; navigation is not a dead end.

**Heading.** Magnetometer when still, GPS course above 0.8 m/s, 8° declination
correction. iOS needs the permission prompt from a tap: Tools ▸ Enable compass.

**Off-route.** Clear under 40 m, amber 40–80 m, alert past 80 m after 3
consecutive fixes, thresholds widen with poor GPS accuracy. Start gate at 50 m
offers reroute-from-here or take-me-to-the-start.

**Saved routes.** Save, list, load, delete. localStorage.

**Offline.** Service worker caches app shell, grids, data and libraries on
install. Tools ▸ Offline maps downloads the 7 archives (~140 MB). Range requests
are sliced from the cached full copy into proper 206 responses — this is subtle
and was a real bug.

## 5. Open items

| # | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Guide stops not tappable | prompts exist in the data, no click handler |
| 2 | Are stops the right idea at all? | they land at 35%/65% of route — a percentage with a hunting word on it |
| 3 | Access points have no road class | maintained gravel and unmaintained 4WD look identical to the router |
| 4 | Line distance tool | stubbed, says "not built yet" |
| 5 | Firebase sync / buddy location | in old build, not ported |
| 6 | GPX export | in old build, not ported |
| 7 | Contours from DEM | would replace scanned-map look |
| 8 | GMU 45 north half | needs quads + DEM for new bounds |

## 6. Eye-level first person — tried, removed, may be revivable

Attempted at pitch 84 / zoom 17 with the walker pushed to the bottom edge.
**Removed in C12.** The reason is data resolution, not code: at zoom 17 the screen
covers ~360 m, and a 10 m DEM gives ~36 elevation samples across it, so terrain
renders as a smooth featureless field. The topo raster has the same ceiling at
~2 m/px.

Also confirmed: **MapLibre GL JS has no free-camera API.** Verified against its
source — `FreeCameraOptions` does not exist in `src/ui/camera.ts`. It is a Mapbox
feature and an open MapLibre request since 2022. So the camera cannot be placed
at an arbitrary point in space.

**Possible revival:** USGS now publishes a **Seamless 1 m DEM (S1M)** for the whole
lower 48, free, no account, via The National Map, as Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF. At
1 m, zoom 17 gives 360 samples instead of 36. Paired with NAIP imagery (~1 m,
public domain) this may make eye level real. Untested — MapLibre's terrain mesh
may simplify geometry regardless of source resolution. **Test on a small area
before building anything around it.**

## 7. Working agreements

**Verification before shipping.** Every bug in this project came from porting code
without checking what it depended on. Required checks before handing over a file:

- diff anything lifted from `index.html` against the original — decodes,
  constants, every function it calls
- walk the dependency tree of every extracted function
- exercise numeric behaviour, do not assume it
- inspect the data before trusting logic that reads it
- confirm no dangling DOM references
- `node --check` the extracted script

**Bugs this caught, or should have:**
- cost grid decoded as 16-bit `(R*256+G)/100` instead of the R byte → costs
  5 orders of magnitude wrong → 8.8 mi route instead of 4.1 mi
- `COST_LOG_MIN/MAX` not carried over → `costAt` returned `NaN` → search wandered
- `distPointToSegment` not carried over → auto-start threw
- callback signature backwards → all grid loads reported as failures
- `Math.max.apply` over 2.3 M values → stack overflow
- 12 "nearest road" candidates were 7 unique points spanning 791 m → auto-start
  never considered the real trailhead

**Every file handed over gets a commit summary line.**

**Build tag** in the top-left readout. Bump it every build. GitHub Pages plus
browser cache plus service worker means the version on screen often is not the
version just pushed — several rounds were lost to this.

**Communication:** plain language, no jargon without explaining it. Consider
second-order consequences before moving.

**Do not overclaim.** Say what was verified and what was assumed.

## 8. Next session plan

**Downloads needed first:**

1. **1 m DEM test tile** — apps.nationalmap.gov, check the 1 m DEM availability
   viewer covers GMU 44, then pull a small area around Mount Thomas
   (`-106.63` to `-106.59`, `39.43` to `39.46`). GeoTIFF.
2. **LANDFIRE** — Forest Canopy Cover + Existing Vegetation Type, GeoTIFF,
   box `-106.92 / -106.32 / 39.18 / 39.55`.
3. **USGS National Map** — Transportation + NHD, same box, Shapefile or
   GeoPackage.

**Order of work:**

1. **Test 1 m DEM, timeboxed.** Tile the small area, look at eye level. If the
   mesh holds up, plan a per-area HD download feature. If not, eye level is dead
   for a verified reason. Settle it in one block either way.
2. **Vectors.** Roads, trails, water as line layers. Biggest visual upgrade —
   sharp at any zoom, upright labels, kills the paper-map look. Also unlocks road
   classification (fixes item 3) and future trail snapping.
3. **LANDFIRE canopy.** Per-cell values fill the reposition scorer's empty
   tiebreak and collapse 4 picture layers into 1.
4. **Open list** — stop taps, contours, line distance, GPX export.

**Then:** GMU 45 north half, and the commercial questions (hosting on Cloudflare
R2, terms of service, LLC, insurance).

## 9. Known data gaps — state these plainly to any future user

- No cliff or rock-band data. A route can cross terrain impassable on foot.
- No private land parcels. A route can cross private property.
- No seasonal closures or wilderness motor-vehicle restrictions.
- No water-crossing data.
- No road classification — a 4WD two-track scores like a maintained road.
- The hotspot model does not account for private-land refuge effect, which is
  documented behaviour for the White River herd under pressure.
